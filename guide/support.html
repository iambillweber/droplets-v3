					<p class="lead">If you are experiencing issues implementing the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, please follow the procedure stated below. Level 3 VIP passes are restricted to few individuals.</p>
					
					<h2>Level 1</h2>
					<p>This is the initial support level responsible for handling basic questions and issues stemming from instructional designers. Designers well-versed in writing and creating content pages using the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework will provide level 1 support to their colleagues. How that support structure is designed and executed is up to the Design and Development team.</p>
					
					<div class="callout callout-guide info">
					    <p><strong>FYI:</strong> Whether if level 1 support is available or not, it is always a good idea to check out the <a href="https://github.com/oel-mediateam/idstyleguide/issues" target="_blank">Issues</a> page on <a href="https://github.com/oel-mediateam/idstyleguide/" target="_blank">Media Team GitHub</a> account. Your issue or question might already been reported or answered.</p>
					</div>
					
					<h2>Level 2</h2>
					<p>This is a more in-depth technical support level that often involves complexity and intricacy in the HTML creation. If level 1 support is insufficient, please contact Bryan Bortz via email to set up a 1:1 consultation and provide the information listed below:</p>
					<ul>
					    <li>Code snippet</li>
					    <li>Screen shot of display issues (if available)</li>
					    <li>Course information (if available)</li>
					</ul>
					<p>During the consultation, Bryan will work directly with the designer to resolve their issues and/or questions.</p>
					
					<h2>Level 3</h2>
					<p>This is the highest level of support in our three-tiered technical support model responsible for handling the most advanced problems. Problems should rarely escalate to level 3 support but if they do, Bryan will work directly with Ethan to layout the problem and discuss possible solutions. This will be transparent to designers and is in place to give Bryan an outlet for his inquiries.</p>
					
					<hr />
					
					<h2>Feature Requests</h2>
					<p>Additional feature requests from the design and development staff should be discussed within the team to determine if itâ€™s a viable need. If it is, please submit the request to our <a href="https://github.com/oel-mediateam/idstyleguide/issues" target="_blank">Media Team GitHub</a> account. Ethan monitors our account on a regular basis and is automatically alerted when new requests come in.</p>
					
					<h2>Bug Reporting</h2>
					<p>If you discover a bug please report it to a level 1 support person to confirm the issue. If it is indeed a bug, please report the issue on our <a href="https://github.com/oel-mediateam/idstyleguide/issues" target="_blank">Media Team GitHub</a> account. Ethan monitors our account on a regular basis and is automatically alerted when bugs are reported.</p>
