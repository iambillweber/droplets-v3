					<p class="lead">If you are experiencing issues implementing the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, please follow the procedure stated below.</p>

					<h2>Level 1</h2>
					<p>This is the initial support level responsible for handling basic questions and issues stemming from instructional designers. Designers well-versed in writing and creating content pages using the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework will provide level 1 support to their colleagues. How that support structure is designed and executed is up to the Design and Development team.</p>

					<h2>Level 2</h2>
					<p>This is a more in-depth technical support level that often involves complexity and intricacy in the HTML creation. If level 1 support is insufficient, please contact Bryan Bortz via email to set up a 1:1 consultation and provide the information listed below:</p>
					<ul>
					    <li>Code snippet</li>
					    <li>Screen shot of display issues (if available)</li>
					    <li>Course information (if available)</li>
					</ul>
					<p>During the consultation, Bryan will work directly with the designer to resolve their issues and/or questions.</p>

					<h2>Level 3</h2>
					<p>This is the highest level of support in our three-tiered technical support model responsible for handling the most advanced problems. Problems should rarely escalate to level 3 support but if they do, Bryan will work directly with Ethan to layout the problem and discuss possible solutions. This will be transparent to designers and is in place to give Bryan an outlet for his inquiries.</p>

					<hr />

					<h2>Reporting Bugs / Glitches</h2>
					<p>If you discover a bug or glitch, report it to a level 1 support personnel to confirm the issue. After confirmed, please report the issue to <a href="https://github.com/oel-mediateam/idstyleguide/issues" target="_blank">Droplets's Repository on GitHub</a>.</p>
